# npm-HAT-CMS

This repository now follows the same core pattern as `../Wieting-Website-CMS`:

- the CMS is a local application,
- the Hugo site is edited on disk,
- the built site is static output,
- deployment is handled by AWS Amplify from repository source.

Netlify and the browser-based Decap admin have been removed from this project.

## What Changed

The old approach depended on a hosted CMS UI and GitHub authentication flow. That made deployment and content editing tightly coupled to a platform-specific setup.

The new approach is local-first:

- `main.py` is a local Flet CMS app
- `cms_core.py` handles frontmatter generation and file naming
- `run.sh` creates a virtual environment and launches the CMS
- Hugo content is written directly into `site/content`
- `npm run build` still produces the deployable static site in `dist/`
- AWS Amplify can rebuild and publish this repository directly from source on each push

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 12+
- Python 3.9+
- npm dependencies installed with `npm install`

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

The Python CMS dependencies are installed automatically the first time you run the launcher.

## Run The CMS

```bash
./run.sh
```

The app opens a local content editor that writes markdown files directly into the Hugo site.

## Build The Site

```bash
npm run build
```

The built site is written to `dist/`. In production, AWS Amplify should generate that output from repository source on each push.

Hugo-only commands also target the same folder:

```bash
npm run build:hugo
npm run start:hugo
```

Both now write to `dist/` (local repository), which matches the VS Code Local Site path.

## Default Workflow

1. Run `./run.sh`.
2. Create or update content in the local CMS app.
3. Save entries into `site/content`.
4. Run `npm run build`.
5. Commit and push your changes.
6. Let AWS Amplify rebuild and publish the site.

## AWS Deployment

This repository is configured for source-driven AWS Amplify deployment.

- Amplify config: [amplify.yml](/Users/mark/GitHub/npm-HAT-CMS/amplify.yml)
- Deployment flow: [DEPLOYMENT_FLOW.md](/Users/mark/GitHub/npm-HAT-CMS/DEPLOYMENT_FLOW.md)
- Setup guide: [DEPLOYMENT.md](/Users/mark/GitHub/npm-HAT-CMS/DEPLOYMENT.md)

Amplify should run `npm ci`, then `npm run build`, then publish `dist/`.

## Alternate Site Root

The CMS defaults to this repository's local Hugo site at `./site`.

If you still want to write directly into another Hugo repository, such as `../npm-HAT`, change the `Hugo Site Root` field in the app. The CMS will then write content into that target site instead.

That lets you use this repository as a local editor even if the real site source remains elsewhere.

## Supported Content Types

The local CMS currently has full UI support for:

- **Event (Markdown)** - dated folder-based entries with support for publish date, location, expiry date, and markdown body
- **Document (PDF)** - dated folder-based entries with embedded PDF support

Other content types (Posts, Plans, Education, Let's Moove page, About page, Calendar page, Contact page) are defined in `cms_core.py` but are disabled in the CMS UI pending full implementation.

### Content Type Details

**Event (Markdown)**
- Fields: Title, Publish Date, Location, Expiry Date, Body, Filename Slug, Draft
- Filenames: auto-generated as `YYYY-MM-DD_slug.md` with date prefix
- Output: `site/content/event/`

**Document (PDF)**
- Fields: Title, Date, PDF File, Filename Slug, Draft
- Filenames: auto-generated as `YYYY-MM-DD_slug.md` and corresponding `YYYY-MM-DD_slug.pdf`
- Output: `site/content/document/` (markdown) and `site/static/pdfs/` (PDF)
- The date is automatically prepended to the filename, so titles should not include the date.
- PDFs are embedded in the markdown via `<embed>` tag

## Files

- `main.py` - Flet desktop-style CMS application
- `cms_core.py` - shared content definitions and markdown generation logic
- `run.sh` - local launcher
- `python-requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for the CMS app
- `site/` - Hugo site source
- `site/static/pdfs/` - PDF files for document embedding
- `site/static/webfonts/` - Font Awesome webfonts
- `dist/` - generated static output after build and the artifact Amplify publishes

## Features

### Date and Time Pickers

Event and Document entries with date/time fields use native Flet date and time picker controls:
- Date fields open a `DatePicker` dialog with calendar UI
- DateTime fields provide both date and time picker buttons
- Time fields open a `TimePicker` dialog
- Pickers are shared as instance variables and added to the page overlay for efficiency

### PDF Embedding

Document entries support embedded PDF viewing:
- Select a local PDF file via the file picker
- The PDF is copied to `site/static/pdfs/` with automatic naming
- Markdown content embeds the PDF via `<embed>` tag pointing to the relative path
- On build, PDFs are included in `dist/pdfs/` for serving

### Font Awesome Icons

The site includes Font Awesome 5.13.0 webfonts:
- Webfont files: `site/static/webfonts/fa-*.{eot,ttf,woff,woff2}`
- CSS: `site/assets/css/fontawesome-free-5.13.0-web-all.min.css`
- Icons can be used in layouts and content via `<i class="fas fa-icon-name">` markup

## Test

```bash
python -m unittest test_cms_core.py
```

## Notes

- The app is intentionally local and file-based. There is no hosted auth flow.
- `npm run build` remains the canonical local verification step for the deployable site output.
- In production, AWS Amplify should rebuild from source instead of consuming files manually uploaded from a local machine.
- If you point the CMS at a different site root, that affects where content is written, not how this repository's own `npm run build` behaves.
- If Local Site opens a blank page, rebuild with `npm run build:hugo` and refresh the localhost tab.
